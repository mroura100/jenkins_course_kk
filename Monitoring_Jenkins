-Instalamos Prometheus en un servidor
-Instalamos Graphana en un servidor
-Instalamos el plugin Prometheus metrics plugin en Jenkins
- Let us now add a scrape config for Jenkins. Update the prometheus configuration file located at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and add the following config under the scrape_configs section:

- job_name: 'Jenkins'
    metrics_path: /prometheus/
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8085']

Once the file is updated, restart prometheus using the below command:

service prometheus restart 

Wait for few seconds before submitting your question.

Note: Here localhost:8085 refers to our Jenkins Controller and the /prometheus/ metrics path is exposed by the prometheus-metrics plugin that we installed previously`

  scrape_timeout: 10s

  honor_timestamps: true

-Now lets test out some queries in Prometheus. Go back to the Prometheus home page (by clicking on the Prometheus button within the UI) and execute the following query:
jenkins_job_count_value

-Let us see now, how we can use Grafana to visualise Jenkins metrics. Grafana is already installed and can be accessed using Grafana button on the top of the terminal.

Grafana credentials are:
UserName: admin
Password: admin123

First of all, let us add Prometheus datasource in Grafana. Follow below given steps for that:
-> Login into Grafana and click on Add your first datasource.
-> Then select Prometheus and enter http://localhost:9090 in the URL box.
-> Finally click on Save and test button at the bottom.
-> Click on Grafana logo to move back to the dashboard.

-Let us create a dashboard in Grafana now to visualise the total number of Jenkins jobs.

Use same Grafana credentials to login:
UserName: admin
Password: admin123

Follow below given steps to create a dashboard in Grafana:

-> Login into Grafana and click on Create your first dashboard.
-> Then click on Add a new panel and at the bottom enter jenkins_job_count_value in the Metrics browser box.
-> Make sure Prometheus is selected as the Data source.
-> On the right side under Panel options, enter Jenkins Jobs Count in Title.
-> Click on Apply button on the top right corner.
-> Finally click on the Save dashboard button (second button on the top right).
-> Enter dashboard name as Jenkins and save it.
